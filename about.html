    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
        Type in someone's phone numer or email to send a joke to them! 
        The random jokes are sourced from two different sources. One 
        <a href="https://github.com/amoudgl/short-jokes-dataset/blob/master/data/reddit-cleanjokes.csv" target="_blank">clean</a> 
        and one <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/abhinavmoudgil95/short-jokes" target="_blank">dirty</a> 
        <b>Note:</b> jokes, recipients, and given identities are logged. And
        no, I will not contact, advertise to, or spam anyone in that list
        (unless they're cute, no promises there). It's mainly for debugging
        and development purposes.
    </p>
